This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It is a simulated tik-tok, with all the functionalities: upload video, like, comment, etc.

## Getting Started

First, clone or download the repository. Run

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

But you can also check the project live [here](https://next-tiktok-clone-eight.vercel.app/)

## Libraries

### Sanity

I am using Sanity to handle the server side. All the information is uploaded and pulled from there. Check this amazing platform [here](https://www.sanity.io/)

## Tailwind

This project uses Tailwind CSS for the styling of components. Its in-built classes speed up the process. All about it [here](https://tailwindcss.com/)
